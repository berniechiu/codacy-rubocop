Checks for extra underscores in variable assignment.

# Examples

```ruby
# bad
a, b, _ = foo()
a, b, _, = foo()
a, _, _ = foo()
a, _, _, = foo()

# good
a, b, = foo()
a, = foo()
*a, b, _ = foo()
# => We need to know to not include 2 variables in a
a, *b, _ = foo()
# => The correction `a, *b, = foo()` is a syntax error# good
a, b, _something = foo()# bad
a, b, _something = foo()
```
