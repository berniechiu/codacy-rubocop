Checks for `if` expressions that do not have an `else` branch.

NOTE: Pattern matching is allowed to have no `else` branch because unlike `if` and `case`,
it raises `NoMatchingPatternError` if the pattern doesn't match and without having `else`.

Supported styles are: if, case, both.

# Examples

```ruby
# warn when an `if` expression is missing an `else` branch.

# bad
if condition
  statement
end

# good
if condition
  statement
else
  # the content of `else` branch will be determined by Style/EmptyElse
end

# good
case var
when condition
  statement
end

# good
case var
when condition
  statement
else
  # the content of `else` branch will be determined by Style/EmptyElse
end# warn when a `case` expression is missing an `else` branch.
