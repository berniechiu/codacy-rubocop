Enforces the presence (default) or absence of parentheses in
method calls containing parameters.

In the default style (require_parentheses), macro methods are allowed.
Additional methods can be added to the `AllowedMethods`
or `AllowedPatterns` list. These options are
valid only in the default style. Macros can be included by
either setting `IgnoreMacros` to false or adding specific macros to
the `IncludedMacros` list.

Precedence of options is all follows:

1. `AllowedMethods`
2. `AllowedPatterns`
3. `IncludedMacros`

eg. If a method is listed in both
`IncludedMacros` and `AllowedMethods`, then the latter takes
precedence (that is, the method is allowed).

In the alternative style (omit_parentheses), there are three additional
options.

1. `AllowParenthesesInChaining` is `false` by default. Setting it to
   `true` allows the presence of parentheses in the last call during
   method chaining.

2. `AllowParenthesesInMultilineCall` is `false` by default. Setting it
    to `true` allows the presence of parentheses in multi-line method
    calls.

3. `AllowParenthesesInCamelCaseMethod` is `false` by default. This
    allows the presence of parentheses when calling a method whose name
    begins with a capital letter and which has no arguments. Setting it
    to `true` allows the presence of parentheses in such a method call
    even with arguments.

NOTE: Parentheses are still allowed in cases where omitting them
results in ambiguous or syntactically incorrect code. For example,
parentheses are required around a method with arguments when inside an
endless method definition introduced in Ruby 3.0. Parentheses are also
allowed when forwarding arguments with the triple-dot syntax introduced
in Ruby 2.7 as omitting them starts an endless range.
And Ruby 3.1's hash omission syntax has a case that requires parentheses
because of the following issue: https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/18396.

# Examples

```ruby

# bad
array.delete e

# good
array.delete(e)

# good
# Operators don't need parens
foo == bar

# good
# Setter methods don't need parens
foo.bar = baz

# okay with `puts` listed in `AllowedMethods`
puts 'test'

# okay with `^assert` listed in `AllowedPatterns`
assert_equal 'test', x
# bad
array.delete(e)

# good
array.delete e

# bad
foo.enforce(strict: true)

# good
foo.enforce strict: true

# good
# Allows parens for calls that won't produce valid Ruby or be ambiguous.
model.validate strict(true)

# good
# Allows parens for calls that won't produce valid Ruby or be ambiguous.
yield path, File.basename(path)

# good
# Operators methods calls with parens
array&.[](index)

# good
# Operators methods without parens, if you prefer
array.[] index

# good
# Operators methods calls with parens
array&.[](index)

# good
# Operators methods without parens, if you prefer
array.[] index
# good
class Foo
  bar :baz
end
# bad
class Foo
  bar :baz
end
# bad
foo.enforce(
  strict: true
)

# good
foo.enforce \
  strict: true
# good
foo.enforce(
  strict: true
)

# good
foo.enforce \
  strict: true
# bad
foo().bar(1)

# good
foo().bar 1
# good
foo().bar(1)

# good
foo().bar 1
# bad
Array(1)

# good
Array 1
# good
Array(1)

# good
Array 1
# bad
"#{t('this.is.bad')}"

# good
"#{t 'this.is.better'}"
# good
"#{t('this.is.good')}"

# good
"#{t 'this.is.also.good'}"
