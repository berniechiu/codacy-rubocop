Identifies places where defining routes with `match`
can be replaced with a specific HTTP method.

Don't use `match` to define any routes unless there is a need to map multiple request types
among [:get, :post, :patch, :put, :delete] to a single action using the `:via` option.

# Examples

```ruby
# bad
match ':controller/:action/:id'
match 'photos/:id', to: 'photos#show', via: :get

# good
get ':controller/:action/:id'
get 'photos/:id', to: 'photos#show'
match 'photos/:id', to: 'photos#show', via: [:get, :post]
match 'photos/:id', to: 'photos#show', via: :all
```
