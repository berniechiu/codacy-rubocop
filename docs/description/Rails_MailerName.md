Enforces that mailer names end with `Mailer` suffix.

Without the `Mailer` suffix it isn't immediately apparent what's a mailer
and which views are related to the mailer.

# Examples

```ruby
# bad
class User < ActionMailer::Base
end

class User < ApplicationMailer
end

# good
class UserMailer < ActionMailer::Base
end

class UserMailer < ApplicationMailer
end
```
