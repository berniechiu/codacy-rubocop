This cop checks for uses of double negation (`!!`) to convert something to a boolean value.

When using `EnforcedStyle: allowed_in_returns`, allow double negation in contexts
that use boolean as a return value. When using `EnforcedStyle: forbidden`, double negation
should be forbidden always.

NOTE: when `something` is a boolean value
`!!something` and `!something.nil?` are not the same thing.
As you're unlikely to write code that can accept values of any type
this is rarely a problem in practice.

# Examples

```ruby
# bad
!!something

# good
!something.nil?# good
def foo?
  !!return_value
end# bad
def foo?
  !!return_value
end
```
