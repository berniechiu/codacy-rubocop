Checks that environments called with `Rails.env` predicates
exist.
By default the cop allows three environments which Rails ships with:
`development`, `test`, and `production`.
More can be added to the `Environments` config parameter.

# Examples

```ruby
# bad
Rails.env.proudction?
Rails.env == 'proudction'

# good
Rails.env.production?
Rails.env == 'production'
```
