Checks that your heredocs are using meaningful delimiters.
By default it disallows `END` and `EO*`, and can be configured through
forbidden listing additional delimiters.

# Examples

```ruby

# good
<<-SQL
  SELECT * FROM foo
SQL

# bad
<<-END
  SELECT * FROM foo
END

# bad
<<-EOS
  SELECT * FROM foo
EOS
```
