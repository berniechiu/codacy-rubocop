in the order in which they will be executed.

# Examples

```ruby
# bad
class Person < ApplicationRecord
  after_commit :after_commit_callback
  before_validation :before_validation_callback
end

# good
class Person < ApplicationRecord
  before_validation :before_validation_callback
  after_commit :after_commit_callback
end
```
